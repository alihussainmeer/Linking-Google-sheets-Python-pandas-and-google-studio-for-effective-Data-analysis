until the ".json" file is downloaded

After it is downloaded we have to install various packages the commands for them are given below:

!pip install gspread

!pip install oauth2client

!pip install PyOpenSSL

!pip install gspread_dataframe


You are supposed to provide the path of the json file where it is mentioned in the program
After that we have to write the name of the sheet where it is mentioned in the program.
Once it is done we have to run it once and press no so that the data in the sheet will be stored in the data frame
then we can make the manipulations in the dataframe and run the program again and press yes to update the google sheets in the real time.
